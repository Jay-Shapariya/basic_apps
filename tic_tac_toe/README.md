# Flutter Tic Tac Toe App

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using the Flutter framework. It allows two players to take turns and play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on a virtual board. This project is a demonstration of how to create a basic interactive app using Flutter.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend on the same device.
- Interactive board: Tap on cells to make your moves.
- Win detection: The game detects when a player has won and displays the winning line.
- Reset functionality: Start a new game anytime.

## How to Play

1.  Launch the app on your device.
2.  The first player (X) will be prompted to make a move.
3.  Tap on an empty cell to place your symbol (X or O).
4.  Alternate turns between players.
5.  The game will automatically detect and display the winning player when three symbols are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or it will detect a draw if the board is full.
